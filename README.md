## ET.02.04 Third Problem
Write and test the necessary methods to calculate the gravitational attraction force between two bodies. In addition to the subsequent semantic considerations of the problem, also take into account the following:

* The user interface will be through the command line. Classes with specific methods for reading from the keyboard and writing strings and numbers to the screen must be developed.
* Use exceptions at those points in the program where it is necessary to control the program flow.
* Do not couple domain classes with the user interface (e.g., do not generate screen outputs in domain logic classes).
